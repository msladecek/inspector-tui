A clojure data inspector for the terminal.
Something like reveal[1] or portal[2] or cider-inspect[3] but running in a terminal.

Multiple ways of running it:
  [done] 1. As a separate thing that gets connected during repl session, like portal
  [done] 2. As a wrapper for the clojure cli that starts nrepl and enables the tap / inspector output automatically.

Server / client over tcp
  [done] In nrepl wrapper mode, nrepl responses are sent to the inspector window over the socket.
  [done] In separate application mode, the tap> sends data to the inspector window over the socket.

Inspector user interface
  [done] Show one piece of data at a time.
  [done] Store previous data in a list.
  [done] Only show as much as fits into the screen, scroll around for the rest.

  Available representations:
    [done] pprint
    [done] table (only when spec allows it)
    [done] recursive table (shows nested table-compliant data as tables)

  Keybindings:
    [done] ?: open help, keybindings
    [done] h, j, k, l: to scroll
    [done] H, L: to move backward and forward in the list
    [done] [, ]: cycle representations
    x: delete datum from the list (opens a confirmation dialog)
    [done] X: delete datum from the list (without a confirmation dialog)
    q: exit (opens a confirmation dialog)
    Q: exit (no confirmation dialog)

Drill-down mode (orchard.inspector)
  h, j, k, l: navigates elements in the data
  return: selected piece of data is added to the list of data

Documentation mode
  d: Add documentation to the viewer

TODO: configure the port
  - configure with a command line argument for viewer
  - make a function that creates a send-data! function with an explicit port
  - use nrepl port +1 if available

TODO: cleanup the readme, particularly the usage section
  - update output examples

TODO: use orchard.inspector https://github.com/clojure-emacs/orchard/blob/master/doc/inspector.org
