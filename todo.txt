A clojure data inspector for the terminal.
Something like reveal[1] or portal[2] or cider-inspect[3] but running in a terminal.

Multiple ways of running it:
  1. As a separate thing that gets connected during repl session, like portal
  2. As a wrapper for the clojure cli that starts nrepl and enables the tap / inspector output automatically.

Server / client over tcp
  Q: Who is the server and who is the client?
  -> not sure, proceed while making it agnostic

  In nrepl wrapper mode, nrepl responses are sent to the inspector window over the socket.
  In separate application mode, the tap> sends data to the inspector window over the socket.

Inspector user interface
  Show one piece of data at a time.
  Store previous data in a list.
  Only show as much as fits into the screen, scroll around for the rest.

  Available representations:
    pprint
    table (only when spec allows it)
    recursive table (shows nested table-compliant data as tables)

  Keybindings:
    ?: open help, keybindings
    h, j, k, l: to scroll
    H, L: to move backward and forward in the list
    [, ]: cycle representations
    x: delete datum from the list (opens a confirmation dialog)
    X: delete datum from the list (without a confirmation dialog)
    q: exit (opens a confirmation dialog)
    Q: exit (no confirmation dialog)

Drill-down mode
  h, j, k, l: navigates elements in the data
  return: selected piece of data is added to the list of data

Documentation mode
  d: Add documentation to the viewer

TODO: nrepl middleware
TODO: configure the port
  - configure with a command line argument for viewer
  - make a function that creates a send-data! function with an explicit port
  - use nrepl port +1 if available
